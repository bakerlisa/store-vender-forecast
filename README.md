## Data Science Predictive Model and Analysis

fig 1: Store counts went down, revenue stayed the same, and more SuperMarket Type 1 are being built

fig 2: Revenue didn't go down because SuperMarket Type 1 was being built and they're bringing in the most revenue. Even though, based on product category they don't have the highest priced items.

### Compilation Breakdown
1. Barplots were chosen because for their simplicity in relaying data quickly and efficiently 
2. One lineplot was chosen because the flow of reverent needed to be show and a lineplot explained that best 

### Summary
Businesses are driven by revenue and sales. First there was an exploration into what was bringing in the most revenue. Upon analysis of the data it became apparent that shopping categories overall revenue had less impact than on the store itself. Further analysis, showed that correlation between store size and type was leading to the stores overall revenue success. That is what these charts so heavily focus on store type and size to generate the final conclusion.  

### Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations to this model consist mainly in its simplicity and lack of data. More factors than just type and size could be affecting the success of the store. For example the size of the city, other store in the area, could adobe playin a part.

Based on the information that has been curated, the best next step is to test our theory on live data to give a better idea on how your predictions will play out in the future.

### Results
Bagged Regression model will be the best model to use

### Limitations & Next Steps
Our prediviet models are not very accurate and our large numbers are being penalized. We're unable to get out numbers above .6 range, in order to get a better model, more data is needed.
